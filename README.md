- [Structure without list](src/structure_without_list.py)  
Task provided by Alexander Pushkarev in [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Qx3-2oZpVY) on his YouTube channel  
  Develop class that contains tree public methods:
  - void add(item) - adding any object to this class;  
  - object get(index) - getting previously added item. The first item will be returned by get(1), the second - get(2), and so on;  
  - void delete(index) - deleting previously added iem by its sequence number.  

Special condition: there're no lists, arrays, collections in programming language you will use (or simply don't use them).
